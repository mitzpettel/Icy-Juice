# Headers are installed in ${pkgincludedir}/libicq2000, this will allow
# multiple versions of the library to be installed in future without
# their headers overlapping (by varying the pkgincludedir with
# versioning information). Also it means a client compiling with the
# library will have to explicitly use the -I flag for the library
# headers it needs, guaranteeing it knows what it's getting, typically
# this will be got from the libicq2000-config script.
